        The magical island were everything is made of candy and brussels sprouts.<br>
        And in the middle of the island there's a huge fountain of beer.

        We wanted to go home, but we didn't see any way around. <br>
        One of us said to let's go to a fountain of bear maybe we could found a clue to back home. <br>
        On our way, we encountered a group of fairies they were kind and helpful. They led us to a fountain where all magic comes.
