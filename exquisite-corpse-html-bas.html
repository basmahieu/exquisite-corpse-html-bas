        Four of us. We were the only ones left, the only ones to make it to the island.<br>
        The magical island were everything is made of candy and brussels sprouts.<br>
        And in the middle of the island there's a huge fountain of beer.

        The first thought was to panic, but the island was odly calming.<br>
        We had food and drink all around the island, you could say we where lucky to be here.<br>
        But there was something stange, as the more we looked the less signs of life we found.
